# **INTRODUCTION**

 Air pollution is the contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical, or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere (WHO). According to WHO data, almost the entire global population (99%) breathes air that exceeds WHO guideline limits, containing high levels of pollutants. Low- and middle-income countries suffer the most from these high exposures. A report by The Guardian in November 2023 highlighted the impact of this issue, noting that pollution from fossil fuels contributes to approximately 5 million deaths annually, making this a critical public health concern.

 This project utilizes data from the WAQI API to generate real-time air quality data for Lahore, Pakistan. Notably, PM2.5 is the major air pollutant in Lahore, which has been listed by IQAir as the most polluted city in the world. This pollutant is the primary focus of this project. The goal of this project is to enhance public awareness of this severe issue among the inhabitants of Lahore and to provide timely health advice through SMS alerts when air quality is poor, with the aim of potentially improving health outcomes over the long term.


# **METHODOLOGY**

 The data for this project was sourced using the WAQI API. The procedure involved various steps:

- **API documentation review**: Understanding the capabilities and data access methods provided by the API.

- **Account creation and API token acquisition**: Important steps that facilitated access to the needed data.

- **AQI threshold identification**: Determining safe and dangerous AQI levels to tailor the alerts.

- **Twilio API integration and API token acquisition**: Setting up a system to send SMS alerts when AQI levels are detrimental to health.

- **Communication strategy**: Opting for text messaging as the primary communication channel due to its immediacy and wide reach.

- **Data visualization**: Plotting a line graph to visually represent AQI forecasts for a ten-day period, enhancing the interpretation of the data.

```{r fetch_data, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, results = 'hide')
# Function to fetch latest air quality data from AQICN API for a specified city
fetch_air_quality_data <- function(city = "Lahore") {
  base_url <- "http://api.waqi.info/feed/"
  params <- list(
    token = Sys.getenv("AQI_API_KEY"),  # API key stored as an environment variable
    city = city
  )
  
  response <- GET(url = paste0(base_url, city), query = params)
  response_content <- content(response, "text")
  print(paste("HTTP Status Code:", status_code(response)))  # Print status code for debugging
  print(response_content)  # Print the raw response content for debugging
  
  # Parse JSON response only if the HTTP status is OK
  if (status_code(response) == 200) {
    data <- fromJSON(response_content)
    iaqi <- data$data$iaqi  # Simplified path to the air quality index data
    
    # Prepare a simple list to store the results with NA as default for missing data
    results <- list(
      pm25 = if(!is.null(iaqi$pm25)) iaqi$pm25$v else NA
    )
    
    return(results)
  } else {
    warning("Failed to fetch data: HTTP Status Code - ", status_code(response))
    return(NULL)
  }
}

# Fetch air quality data for Lahore and print results
air_quality_data <- fetch_air_quality_data()
print(air_quality_data)

```

# **RESULTS**

 The system effectively alerts Lahore's inhabitants of high PM2.5 levels, providing the with timely health advice. This rapid dissemination of information help individuals take necessary precautions to safeuard their health. In adition a line graph that visually represents the AQI forecasts for a ten-day period, enhancing the interpretabity of the data.
